*This is my first own mobile app, which is meant to calculate how many days left to a specified date.*

It gives a possibility to show time in  few options : Years, Months, Days, Hours, Minutes, Seconds. It will be expanded someday, most probably.

**How to set it up locally?** &#129047;

>  You must have working properly Android / iOS Emulator  or your own device configured with flutter.

>  Tutorial how to install and configure it all can be found here: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install

>  If everything is configured, while in main directory, type `flutter pub get` afterwards`flutter run`  to start app in your emulator.

**I am a very begginner, so every pull-request for code improvment is welcome and appreciated!**
