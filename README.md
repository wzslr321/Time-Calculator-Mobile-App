*This is my first own mobile app, which is meant to calculate how many days left to a specified date.*

*It gives a possibility to choose between few options like : week days only, show time in hours,minutes  etc.*

**How to set it up locally?** &#129047;

> You must have working properly Android / iOS Emulator  or your own device configured with flutter.

>  Tutorial how to install and configure it all can be found here: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install

 If everything is configured, while in main directory, type `flutter run`  to start app in your emulator.
